#The SELECT command is used to show data from a database.

#The output from a SELECT statement is always a grid - with a number of rows and a number of columns.

#Simple SELECT
#The simplest SELECT commands involve a single table:

SQL	                                Result
SELECT name, population             name	                    population
  FROM bbc                          Canada	                    32000000
 WHERE region='North America'       United States of America	295000000

#The SELECT line determines which columns to show - in this case name and population, both of which are columns of the bbc table.
#The WHERE clause determines which rows to show
#The SELECT statement may involve data from more than one table using a JOIN or a UNION.
#SELECT statements may nested - that is the output from one SELECT may be the input to another SELECT.
#The output from a SELECT may be added to another table using INSERT .. SELECT
#The select statement may aggregate values using a SELECT .. GROUP BY clause


#Concatenate Columns

#You can put two or more strings together using the concatenate operator.

#1. You can put two or more strings together using the concatenate operator. The SQL standard says you should use || but there are many differences between the main vendors.

SELECT CONCAT(region, name)
  FROM bbc

Result:
CONCAT(region..
AfricaAngola
AfricaBenin


#Like

#How do I use LIKE in a sql SELECT statement.

#1. The LIKE command allows "Wild cards". A % may be used to match and string, _ will match any single character.

#The example shows countries begining with Z. The country Zambia matches because ambia matches with the %.

SELECT name FROM bbc
WHERE name LIKE 'Z%'

Result:
name
Zambia
Zimbabwe


#Apostrophe

#How to build a statement on a word with an Apostrophe such as WHERE name='Tom's Book'

SELECT * FROM bbc
WHERE name = 'Cote d''Ivoire'


#Full text search

#Full text search with SQL? such as i want to find a specific word in any colum of the table

#1. The "brute force" method is to use use the LIKE operator against any of the fields to be searched. This will be relatively expensive - but probably good enough in many cases. The term to search for should be quoted and placed within two wild cards.

#You should construct the string literal in some scripting language - don't forget to quote it.

SELECT name FROM bbc
WHERE name LIKE '%the%'

Result:
name
The Gambia
St Vincent and the Grenadines
The Philippines
The Netherlands
The Maldives


#Column name

#How can I display a column name for an aggregate function?

#1. Where one of the results returned is calculated (for example with an aggregate) the column name may be assigned arbitrarily.

#You should be able to specify a column name.

SELECT region, SUM(population) AS x
  FROM bbc
GROUP BY region

Result:
region	x
Africa	698081725
Americas	74329000
Asia-Pacific	2173791900
